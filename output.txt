**Background:** Spondylolisthesis is defined as the anterior or posterior translation of one vertebral body over another. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is a developmental anomaly characterized by the incomplete fusion of the laminae of one or more vertebral arches along the midline. Currently, there is no documented prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing spinal surgery. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of SBO in patients with DS undergoing spine surgery and compare it with that in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS) undergoing surgery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.165,t=0.378,r=0.836,b=0.479), with ID a83ab61f-5b68-4085-8a55-c51c1b3eeba0 -->

**Methods:** Our study is a cross-sectional retrospective review of consecutive patient records from two major tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia, covering the period from January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2015 to December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2023. Patients diagnosed with spondylolisthesis at spinal levels L4/L5 or L5/S1 were identified and screened for the presence of SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.166,t=0.479,r=0.835,b=0.545), with ID f784c895-d142-4bf0-b97d-85c70b435a9c -->

**Results:** Among the patients who underwent spinal surgery, 23.4% were found to have spondylolisthesis due to either degenerative changes or isthmic pars defects at L4/L5 or L5/S1. Within the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9% (all at the S1 level), while 24.7% of the IS group exhibited SBO. The male-to-female ratio for patients with IS and SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for those with DS and SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.545,r=0.834,b=0.612), with ID ea07935c-40c5-43d5-8b0f-8c22da964a5e -->

**Conclusions:** SBO is a frequently overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS. With a prevalence of 11.9% in DS, it is crucial for spine surgeons to be vigilant, especially during open posterior lumbar spine fusion surgeries, to prevent unintended durotomy and neurological damage. Awareness of the absence of the S1 spinous process is essential for effective surgical planning, particularly when using navigated spinous process clamps for pedicle screw placement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.612,r=0.835,b=0.697), with ID 2017663f-702c-4593-bfd7-f02d1ea86ee0 -->

**Introduction**

*Background*

The term spondylolisthesis originates from the Greek words “spondylos”, meaning vertebra, and “olisthánein” meaning “to slip” (1). It broadly refers to the displacement of one vertebral body over another. In 1976, Wiltse *et al.* (2) classified spondylolisthesis into five categories: dysplastic, isthmic, degenerative, traumatic, and pathological. Epidemiological data on spondylolisthesis varies widely, with reported prevalence ranging from 2.7% to 28% (3,4), influenced by factors such as age, sex, and whether the population is symptomatic or asymptomatic. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is the most benign form of spina bifida, involves the failure of the laminae to fuse. The prevalence of SBO in adults can be as high as 12.4% (5). While a correlation between SBO and spondylolysis is recognized with prevalence ranging from 22–70% (6), the prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing surgery remains unreported. The most common levels of spondylolisthesis are L4/L5 and L5/S1 (4) and whence we elected to only include those levels in our study. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.071,t=0.106,r=0.484,b=0.494), with ID e36be948-c9a3-40ea-89c8-6388c48f47f8 -->

With the advent of navigated instrumentation and spinal process clamps, awareness of the absence of the spinous process is vital for effective surgical planning. There is no reported prevalence of SBO in a surgical cohort with DS. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.515,t=0.108,r=0.928,b=0.192), with ID 57de79db-25bc-4fc9-91ed-f92f55369c66 -->

*Objective*

This study aims to quantify the prevalence of SBO in a cohort of surgical patients with either DS or isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS). Most existing studies on spondylolisthesis prevalence focus on asymptomatic populations, neglecting symptomatic surgical cohorts. Our research seeks to raise awareness of SBO and quantify its prevalence among patients treated for symptomatic lower back pathology, categorizing them based on degenerative versus IS and the presence or absence of SBO. We present this article in accordance with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at https://jss.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/jss-24-151/rc). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.515,t=0.216,r=0.928,b=0.443), with ID 9d0001b0-eda3-4c73-b94f-72885cb3fbc3 -->

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional retrospective review of patient records from two tertiary hospitals in Sydney (Nepean Public Hospital and Westmead Public Hospital), covering surgeries conducted between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2023. Surgeries were performed by both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. Inclusion criteria included patients aged over 18 years who underwent surgery at spinal levels L4–S1, with imaging available for review. Exclusion criteria encompassed surgeries at levels other than L4–S1, surgeries conducted prior to the study period, unavailability of imaging, and spondylolisthesis due to causes other than degenerative or isthmic factors, spondylolisthesis at level other than L4–S1 (*Table 1*). Patients’ electronic medical records were accessed, and baseline demographic data (age, sex) were collected. Imaging [X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] was reviewed for the presence of spondylolisthesis, its level, aetiology (based on Wiltse classification), grade (according to Meyerding grading), and presence of SBO and its level. Other pathologies like spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were screened for. Most patients’ images were available on the hospitals Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS); however, some patients had their images done at private radiology providers outside the hospital PACS. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.514,t=0.466,r=0.929,b=0.913), with ID 6fca94ee-6dfc-44d8-8cf1-61677ffd6d91 -->

For those patients the individual radiology provider was contacted for access to patients scans. The authors (A.A.W., Y.L.) reviewed the images, consulting reporting radiologists in cases of disagreement. CT scan for some patients was not available, and data collection was reliant on MRI and X-rays. Patients who had no images available for review were excluded. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.070,t=0.271,r=0.487,b=0.389), with ID 92c7926a-e626-47cd-a9dc-ae229482c577 -->

Sampling bias was reduced by taking all effort to include all patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria in both hospital sites and including patients operated on by both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. Patients with no scans available were excluded. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.071,t=0.391,r=0.486,b=0.474), with ID 9fac3034-ae4d-4b50-94c9-e71e9f3f54e4 -->

Power calculation was conducted to determine the sample size required to detect a significant difference of SBO prevalence between DS and IS. The analysis aimed for a power of 0.8 with an alpha level set at 0.05, indicating a 5% risk of type 1 error. Based on expected prevalence of 12% in DS and 30% in IS, the required sample sizes were calculated to be 173 in DS and 58 in IS, resulting in a total sample size of 231 participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments. Local institutional ethical approval was obtained from Research Ethics and Governance for the Nepean and Blue Mountains Local Health District (No. 2024/ETH02073). Both participating hospitals were informed and agreed on the study. Because of the retrospective nature of the study, the requirement for informed consent was waived. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.071,t=0.475,r=0.486,b=0.745), with ID 32898f42-ecac-4de3-bef7-9679167b4a52 -->

*Statistical analysis*

Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics version 25, reporting median age of patients, prevalence of DS and IS, presence or absence of SBO, spinal level of SBO. Chi-squared test and Fisher’s Exact probability test were used for categorical variables and *T*-test for continuous variable. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.072,t=0.770,r=0.486,b=0.898), with ID ec3e9f5c-86af-4212-a5ef-97e405e7ab57 -->

Results

A total of 2,007 patient records were reviewed, with 351 excluded based on the exclusion criteria. Imaging for 1,656 patients was analysed, of which 20 lacked available images; 388 patients were diagnosed with spondylolisthesis, yielding a prevalence of 23.4% among all surgical patients (Figure 1). Of those patients we reviewed CT lumbar spine in 343 patients, and the rest (n=45) we reviewed MRI Lumbar spine along with lumbar spine X-rays. No cases with spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were observed. Mean age in DS group was 69 (range, 41–91) years, and in IS group was 54 (range, 23–83) years (P<0.05) (Table 2). In the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9%, while in the IS group, it was 24.7% (P value =0.002). Patients with DS and SBO were more likely to present with grade 2 spondylolisthesis compared to those without SBO [risk ratio (RR) 3.09, P value =0.04]. The male-to-female ratio for IS patients with SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for DS patients with SBO (P value =0.004) (Table 3). All patients with DS and SBO had their defect level at S1. Whereas in the IS and SBO group (n=23), 3 patients had their defect at L5, 16 at S1, 2 at L5 and S1, 2 had S1–S4 bifid spine (Table 4). <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.513,t=0.270,r=0.929,b=0.664), with ID b06f96f2-2a93-4e7b-acc4-97f40d62f74b -->

Discussion

Our findings indicate that the prevalence of SBO in DS surgical patients is 11.9%, comparable to the 12.4% prevalence reported by Eubanks in the general population. Conversely, the 24.7% prevalence of SBO in IS surgical patients contrasts with the 41.2% reported in paediatric populations by Urrutia _et al._ (7), potentially reflecting differences in spinal maturity (8). Additionally, patients with DS and SBO exhibited a higher grade of spondylolisthesis, suggesting a possible biomechanical weakness, although this was argued by Sairyo _et al._ (9).

Summary : This flowchart details the inclusion and exclusion process for patients in a study of spinal operations, ultimately categorizing patients with spondylolisthesis into isthmic and degenerative subtypes.

flowchart:
# Nodes :
  • Total spinal operations (rectangle): "Total spinal operations (n=2,007)"
  • Prior surgery (rectangle): "Prior surgery (n=107)"
  • No prior surgery (rectangle): "No prior surgery (n=1,900)"
  • Patients met exclusion criteria (rectangle): "Patients met exclusion criteria (n=224)"
  • Patients met inclusion criteria (rectangle): "Patients met inclusion criteria (n=1,676)"
  • Images not available (rectangle): "Images not available (n=20)"
  • Images available (rectangle): "Images available (n=1,656)"
  • Patients without spondylolisthesis (rectangle): "Patients without spondylolisthesis (n=1,268)"
  • Patients with spondylolisthesis (rectangle): "Patients with spondylolisthesis (n=388)"
  • Isthmic spondylolisthesis (rectangle): "Isthmic spondylolisthesis (n=93)"
  • Degenerative spondylolisthesis (rectangle): "Degenerative spondylolisthesis (n=295)"

# Connectors :
  • Downward arrows connect each main step in the inclusion process.
  • Rightward arrows branch off at each exclusion step:
    – From "Total spinal operations" to "Prior surgery"
    – From "No prior surgery" to "Patients met exclusion criteria"
    – From "Patients met inclusion criteria" to "Images not available"
    – From "Images available" to "Patients without spondylolisthesis"
  • The final node "Patients with spondylolisthesis" splits into two downward arrows to "Isthmic spondylolisthesis" and "Degenerative spondylolisthesis".

# Layout :
  • The flowchart is arranged vertically, with exclusion criteria branching to the right at each step.
  • The final categorization splits horizontally at the bottom into two subtypes.

# Analysis :
  • The flowchart demonstrates a stepwise narrowing of the patient cohort from 2,007 total spinal operations to 388 patients with spondylolisthesis, further divided into 93 with isthmic and 295 with degenerative spondylolisthesis.
  • The largest exclusions occurred at the "Patients without spondylolisthesis" (n=1,268) and "Patients met exclusion criteria" (n=224) steps.
  • The process ensures that only patients meeting strict criteria and with available imaging are included in the final analysis. <!-- figure, from page 3 (l=0.072,t=0.103,r=0.746,b=0.571), with ID cefb1039-2e03-4642-9c69-1dd19246e4f7 -->

Limitations of our study include its retrospective nature and the restricted population from two public hospitals in Western Sydney, as well as incomplete access to some imaging studies. Forty-five patients with spondylolisthesis had MRI lumbar spine but no CT lumbar spine available for review. This study is limited to spinal levels L4–S1. However, it included patients listed for surgery over a long-time span (2015 to 2023), from two different tertiary public hospitals, treated under the care of both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. This makes this research more generalizable in public hospital setting treating <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.071,t=0.540,r=0.486,b=0.728), with ID 5d3e51e8-caca-4006-9f5d-557b0f4da28d -->

lower lumbar spine pathology. This research is the first
to specifically examine a surgical cohort regarding the
prevalence of SBO, making it particularly relevant for adult
spine surgeons. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.515,t=0.299,r=0.928,b=0.367), with ID 26f754c8-427c-4411-a8fa-16f904da36bb -->

To mitigate biases inherent in retrospective studies, future research should establish a prospective database for patient data collection and create a national database for centralized data collection from all public and private centres. Further investigations should also assess the risk of unintended durotomy associated with unrecognized SBO, emphasizing the importance of awareness regarding this rare but preventable complication. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.514,t=0.368,r=0.929,b=0.504), with ID db607875-9ba2-4710-97d3-3e6a0027b56a -->

## Conclusions

SBO is an often-overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS. With a prevalence of 11.9% in DS at the lower lumbar spine, it is sufficiently common that spine surgeons should routinely consider it, especially when planning open posterior lumbar spine fusion surgeries to avoid unintended durotomy and neurological damage. Awareness of the absence of the S1 spinous process is crucial for effective surgical planning, particularly when utilizing navigated spinous process clamps for pedicle screw placement (*Figure 2*). <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.514,t=0.529,r=0.929,b=0.727), with ID 2b2364e4-e72f-4fc1-aded-35ac3ccea299 -->

Summary : This figure presents two computed tomography (CT) images of the lumbar spine in different planes, illustrating vertebral anatomy and alignment.

photo:  
# Panel Overview :
  • Panel A (left): Sagittal CT image of the lumbar spine.
  • Panel B (right): Axial CT image of a lumbar vertebra.

# Scene Overview :
  • Main subject: Bony structures of the lumbar spine.
  • Panel A: Side (sagittal) view showing multiple vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and the spinal canal.
  • Panel B: Top-down (axial) view through a single lumbar vertebra, displaying the vertebral body, pedicles, laminae, spinous process, and surrounding bony anatomy.
  • Both images are grayscale, typical of CT bone window settings.

# Technical Details :
  • Imaging modality: Computed tomography (CT), bone window.
  • No visible scale bar or on-image text other than panel labels ("A", "B").
  • High contrast between bone (white) and soft tissue/air (dark).

# Spatial Relationships :
  • Panel A: Vertebral bodies are aligned vertically; intervertebral disc spaces are visible between them; the spinal canal is posterior to the vertebral bodies.
  • Panel B: Vertebral body is central; pedicles extend laterally; spinous process projects posteriorly; vertebral foramen is centrally located.

# Analysis :
  • The images clearly demonstrate normal lumbar vertebral anatomy in two orthogonal planes.
  • No obvious fractures, dislocations, or gross deformities are visible in these images.
  • The sagittal view (A) allows assessment of vertebral alignment and disc spaces, while the axial view (B) provides detail of the vertebral arch and canal. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.091,t=0.106,r=0.906,b=0.369), with ID 99b74d12-6bf1-4050-895d-dc3861736cca -->

**Background:** Spondylolisthesis is defined as the anterior or posterior translation of one vertebral body over another. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is a developmental anomaly characterized by the incomplete fusion of the laminae of one or more vertebral arches along the midline. Currently, there is no documented prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing spinal surgery. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of SBO in patients with DS undergoing spine surgery and compare it with that in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS) undergoing surgery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.165,t=0.378,r=0.836,b=0.479), with ID 5b3cf0ef-11c2-41cb-bbfa-f3b5dd0deceb -->

**Methods:** Our study is a cross-sectional retrospective review of consecutive patient records from two major tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia, covering the period from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2023. Patients diagnosed with spondylolisthesis at spinal levels L4/L5 or L5/S1 were identified and screened for the presence of SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.166,t=0.479,r=0.835,b=0.545), with ID 38d79b22-c437-4b2f-b4b1-c9e5f7aa0e08 -->

**Results:** Among the patients who underwent spinal surgery, 23.4% were found to have spondylolisthesis due to either degenerative changes or isthmic pars defects at L4/L5 or L5/S1. Within the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9% (all at the S1 level), while 24.7% of the IS group exhibited SBO. The male-to-female ratio for patients with IS and SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for those with DS and SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.545,r=0.834,b=0.612), with ID 489171be-23cd-4aa1-9de7-4f192b41a28a -->

**Conclusions:** SBO is a frequently overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS.

Introduction

*Background*

The term spondylolisthesis originates from the Greek words “spondylos”, meaning vertebra, and “olisthánein” meaning “to slip” (1). It broadly refers to the displacement of one vertebral body over another. In 1976, Wiltse *et al.* (2) classified spondylolisthesis into five categories: dysplastic, isthmic, degenerative, traumatic, and pathological. Epidemiological data on spondylolisthesis varies widely, with reported prevalence ranging from 2.7% to 28% (3,4), influenced by factors such as age, sex, and whether the population is symptomatic or asymptomatic. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is the most benign form of spina bifida, involves the failure of the laminae to fuse. The prevalence of SBO in adults can be as high as 12.4% (5). While a correlation between SBO and spondylolysis is recognized with prevalence ranging from 22–70% (6), the prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing surgery remains unreported. The most common levels of spondylolisthesis are L4/L5 and L5/S1 (4) and whence we elected to only include those levels in our study. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.071,t=0.106,r=0.484,b=0.494), with ID ba426c25-cb29-4151-90a2-45f37b3958bd -->

*Objective*

This study aims to quantify the prevalence of SBO in a cohort of surgical patients with either DS or isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS). Most existing studies on spondylolisthesis prevalence focus on asymptomatic populations, neglecting symptomatic surgical cohorts. Our research seeks to raise awareness of SBO and quantify its prevalence among patients treated for symptomatic lower back pathology, categorizing them based on degenerative versus IS and the presence or absence of SBO. We present this article in accordance with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at https://jss.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/jss-24-151/rc). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.515,t=0.216,r=0.928,b=0.443), with ID 02011325-4054-45eb-a1ce-003cf3f64664 -->

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional retrospective review of patient records from two tertiary hospitals in Sydney (Nepean Public Hospital and Westmead Public Hospital), covering surgeries conducted between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2023. Surgeries were performed by both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. Inclusion criteria included patients aged over 18 years who underwent surgery at spinal levels L4–S1, with imaging available for review. Exclusion criteria encompassed surgeries at levels other than L4–S1, surgeries conducted prior to the study period, unavailability of imaging, and spondylolisthesis due to causes other than degenerative or isthmic factors, spondylolisthesis at level other than L4–S1 (*Table 1*). Patients’ electronic medical records were accessed, and baseline demographic data (age, sex) were collected. Imaging [X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] was reviewed for the presence of spondylolisthesis, its level, aetiology (based on Wiltse classification), grade (according to Meyerding grading), and presence of SBO and its level. Other pathologies like spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were screened for. Most patients’ images were available on the hospitals Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS); however, some patients had their images done at private radiology providers outside the hospital PACS. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.514,t=0.466,r=0.929,b=0.913), with ID c24c072b-9a31-4cd0-8442-9000acf2a503 -->

For those patients the individual radiology provider was
contacted for access to patients scans. The authors (A.A.W.,
Y.L.) reviewed the images, consulting reporting radiologists
in cases of disagreement. CT scan for some patients was
not available, and data collection was reliant on MRI and
X-rays. Patients who had no images available for review
were excluded. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.070,t=0.271,r=0.487,b=0.389), with ID f8f8fd49-ac80-4e71-afb6-cadeca5c88e4 -->

Power calculation was conducted to determine the sample size required to detect a significant difference of SBO prevalence between DS and IS. The analysis aimed for a power of 0.8 with an alpha level set at 0.05, indicating a 5% risk of type 1 error. Based on expected prevalence of 12% in DS and 30% in IS, the required sample sizes were calculated to be 173 in DS and 58 in IS, resulting in a total sample size of 231 participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments. Local institutional ethical approval was obtained from Research Ethics and Governance for the Nepean and Blue Mountains Local Health District (No. 2024/ETH02073). Both participating hospitals were informed and agreed on the study. Because of the retrospective nature of the study, the requirement for informed consent was waived. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.071,t=0.475,r=0.486,b=0.745), with ID 8d35739f-3c5a-402c-aebd-8e56b011fbc3 -->

*Statistical analysis*

Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics version 25, reporting median age of patients, prevalence of DS and IS, presence or absence of SBO, spinal level of SBO. Chi-squared test and Fisher’s Exact probability test were used for categorical variables and *T*-test for continuous variable. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.072,t=0.770,r=0.486,b=0.898), with ID fc999588-1b0d-4487-bb96-184e3a6ef1e4 -->

## Results

A total of 2,007 patient records were reviewed, with 351 excluded based on the exclusion criteria. Imaging for 1,656 patients was analysed, of which 20 lacked available images; 388 patients were diagnosed with spondylolisthesis, yielding a prevalence of 23.4% among all surgical patients (*Figure 1*). Of those patients we reviewed CT lumbar spine in 343 patients, and the rest (n=45) we reviewed MRI Lumbar spine along with lumbar spine X-rays. No cases with spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were observed. Mean age in DS group was 69 (range, 41–91) years, and in IS group was 54 (range, 23–83) years (P<0.05) (*Table 2*). In the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9%, while in the IS group, it was 24.7% (P value =0.002). Patients with DS and SBO were more likely to present with grade 2 spondylolisthesis compared to those without SBO [risk ratio (RR) 3.09, P value =0.04]. The male-to-female ratio for IS patients with SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for DS patients with SBO (P value =0.004) (*Table 3*). All patients with DS and SBO had their defect level at S1. Whereas in the IS and SBO group (n=23), 3 patients had their defect at L5, 16 at S1, 2 at L5 and S1, 2 had S1–S4 bifid spine (*Table 4*). <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.513,t=0.270,r=0.929,b=0.664), with ID 36522a39-99e7-4102-b750-2e529f7816c0 -->

Discussion

Our findings indicate that the prevalence of SBO in DS surgical patients is 11.9%, comparable to the 12.4% prevalence reported by Eubanks in the general population. Conversely, the 24.7% prevalence of SBO in IS surgical patients contrasts with the 41.2% reported in paediatric populations by Urrutia et al. (7), potentially reflecting differences in spinal maturity (8). Additionally, patients with DS and SBO exhibited a higher grade of spondylolisthesis, suggesting a possible biomechanical weakness, although this was argued by Sairoyo et al. (9).

Limitations of our study include its retrospective nature
and the restricted population from two public hospitals
in Western Sydney, as well as incomplete access to some
imaging studies. Forty-five patients with spondylolisthesis
had MRI lumbar spine but no CT lumbar spine available
for review. This study is limited to spinal levels L4–S1.
However, it included patients listed for surgery over a long-
time span (2015 to 2023), from two different tertiary public
hospitals, treated under the care of both neurosurgeons
and orthopaedic spine surgeons. This makes this research
more generalizable in public hospital setting treating <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.071,t=0.540,r=0.486,b=0.728), with ID fda37379-7700-41b8-b964-27b5c83dde18 -->

lower lumbar spine pathology. This research is the first
to specifically examine a surgical cohort regarding the
prevalence of SBO, making it particularly relevant for adult
spine surgeons. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.515,t=0.299,r=0.928,b=0.367), with ID 59f4fb29-3d3d-478f-861c-0628e42a09ca -->

To mitigate biases inherent in retrospective studies, future research should establish a prospective database for patient data collection and create a national database for centralized data collection from all public and private centres. Further investigations should also assess the risk of unintended durotomy associated with unrecognized SBO, emphasizing the importance of awareness regarding this rare but preventable complication. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.514,t=0.368,r=0.929,b=0.504), with ID 54fd1e02-b172-46f9-872d-ce4e66767f90 -->

## Conclusions

SBO is an often-overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS. With a prevalence of 11.9% in DS at the lower lumbar spine, it is sufficiently common that spine surgeons should routinely consider it, especially when planning open posterior lumbar spine fusion surgeries to avoid unintended durotomy and neurological damage. Awareness of the absence of the S1 spinous process is crucial for effective surgical planning, particularly when utilizing navigated spinous process clamps for pedicle screw placement (*Figure 2*). <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.514,t=0.529,r=0.929,b=0.727), with ID cf003855-44a8-4861-9725-d9eee0fbae78 -->

  • The images are arranged left-to-right: C, D (sagittal), then E (axial).

# Analysis :
  • The images provide clear visualization of bony structures of the lower spine and pelvis.
  • No obvious fractures, dislocations, or gross deformities are visible in the provided slices.
  • The arrangement allows comparison of sagittal and axial anatomy, useful for assessing alignment and integrity of the vertebrae and pelvic bones. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.087,t=0.370,r=0.908,b=0.635), with ID e1bb1149-0c2a-4ef6-873e-c5278ba20fce -->

**Background:** Spondylolisthesis is defined as the anterior or posterior translation of one vertebral body over another. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is a developmental anomaly characterized by the incomplete fusion of the laminae of one or more vertebral arches along the midline. Currently, there is no documented prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing spinal surgery. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of SBO in patients with DS undergoing spine surgery and compare it with that in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS) undergoing surgery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.165,t=0.378,r=0.836,b=0.479), with ID bc10ef23-5586-4b80-b291-f5475d462060 -->

**Methods:** Our study is a cross-sectional retrospective review of consecutive patient records from two major tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia, covering the period from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2023. Patients diagnosed with spondylolisthesis at spinal levels L4/L5 or L5/S1 were identified and screened for the presence of SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.166,t=0.479,r=0.835,b=0.545), with ID c52a4916-bdbe-403c-9236-bf3ec13af5ae -->

**Results:** Among the patients who underwent spinal surgery, 23.4% were found to have spondylolisthesis due to either degenerative changes or isthmic pars defects at L4/L5 or L5/S1. Within the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9% (all at the S1 level), while 24.7% of the IS group exhibited SBO. The male-to-female ratio for patients with IS and SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for those with DS and SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.545,r=0.834,b=0.612), with ID 84648710-0414-4105-96d3-d979b4cd2a95 -->

**Conclusions:** SBO is a frequently overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS. With a prevalence of 11.9% in DS, it is crucial for spine surgeons to be vigilant, especially during open posterior lumbar spine fusion surgeries, to prevent unintended durotomy and neurological damage. Awareness of the absence of the S1 spinous process is essential for effective surgical planning, particularly when using navigated spinous process clamps for pedicle screw placement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.612,r=0.835,b=0.697), with ID cf0cb660-88c6-438f-a17a-8d87f2bc29a4 -->

Introduction

*Background*

The term spondylolisthesis originates from the Greek words “spondylos”, meaning vertebra, and “olisthánein” meaning “to slip” (1). It broadly refers to the displacement of one vertebral body over another. In 1976, Wiltse *et al.* (2) classified spondylolisthesis into five categories: dysplastic, isthmic, degenerative, traumatic, and pathological. Epidemiological data on spondylolisthesis varies widely, with reported prevalence ranging from 2.7% to 28% (3,4), influenced by factors such as age, sex, and whether the population is symptomatic or asymptomatic. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is the most benign form of spina bifida, involves the failure of the laminae to fuse. The prevalence of SBO in adults can be as high as 12.4% (5). While a correlation between SBO and spondylolysis is recognized with prevalence ranging from 22–70% (6), the prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing surgery remains unreported. The most common levels of spondylolisthesis are L4/L5 and L5/S1 (4) and whence we elected to only include those levels in our study. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.071,t=0.106,r=0.484,b=0.494), with ID b043572c-6823-4823-a0eb-6290a8f3d0e5 -->

*Rationale and knowledge gap*

**Key findings**
- • Prevalence of spina bifida occulta with spondylolisthesis is 14.9%.
- • Prevalence of spina bifida occulta with degenerative spondylolisthesis 11.9%.
- • Prevalence of spina bifida occulta with isthmic spondylolisthesis is 24.7%.

**What is known and what is new?**
- • Prevalence of spina bifida occulta in the general population ranges 7.4–12.4%.
- • Prevalence of spina bifida occulta in a surgical cohort focused on the L4–S1 levels is 14.9%.

**What is the implication, and what should change now?**
- • Increased awareness of this occult condition to help plan safe surgery on the lumbar spine.
- • Careful examination of pre-operative imaging for patients planned for surgery on the lower lumbar spine screening for spina bifida occulta. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.077,t=0.613,r=0.480,b=0.909), with ID d10612dc-5df4-44e5-8b9c-ade1fdbb4ae1 -->

neural elements due to unrecognized bony defects. With the advent of navigated instrumentation and spinal process clamps, awareness of the absence of the spinous process is vital for effective surgical planning. There is no reported prevalence of SBO in a surgical cohort with DS. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.515,t=0.108,r=0.928,b=0.192), with ID 1e6887b3-8d29-4c38-b1ea-fc69a64432d3 -->

*Objective*

This study aims to quantify the prevalence of SBO in a cohort of surgical patients with either DS or isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS). Most existing studies on spondylolisthesis prevalence focus on asymptomatic populations, neglecting symptomatic surgical cohorts. Our research seeks to raise awareness of SBO and quantify its prevalence among patients treated for symptomatic lower back pathology, categorizing them based on degenerative versus IS and the presence or absence of SBO. We present this article in accordance with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at https://jss.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/jss-24-151/rc). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.515,t=0.216,r=0.928,b=0.443), with ID e04acfb1-29dd-4b5b-9252-e295ffc0dd2b -->

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional retrospective review of patient records from two tertiary hospitals in Sydney (Nepean Public Hospital and Westmead Public Hospital), covering surgeries conducted between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2023. Surgeries were performed by both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. Inclusion criteria included patients aged over 18 years who underwent surgery at spinal levels L4–S1, with imaging available for review. Exclusion criteria encompassed surgeries at levels other than L4–S1, surgeries conducted prior to the study period, unavailability of imaging, and spondylolisthesis due to causes other than degenerative or isthmic factors, spondylolisthesis at level other than L4–S1 (*Table 1*). Patients’ electronic medical records were accessed, and baseline demographic data (age, sex) were collected. Imaging [X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] was reviewed for the presence of spondylolisthesis, its level, aetiology (based on Wiltse classification), grade (according to Meyerding grading), and presence of SBO and its level. Other pathologies like spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were screened for. Most patients’ images were available on the hospitals Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS); however, some patients had their images done at private radiology providers outside the hospital PACS. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.514,t=0.466,r=0.929,b=0.913), with ID d43dccbd-a574-470e-8fc5-37e44fb67b58 -->

Power calculation was conducted to determine the sample size required to detect a significant difference of SBO prevalence between DS and IS. The analysis aimed for a power of 0.8 with an alpha level set at 0.05, indicating a 5% risk of type 1 error. Based on expected prevalence of 12% in DS and 30% in IS, the required sample sizes were calculated to be 173 in DS and 58 in IS, resulting in a total sample size of 231 participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments. Local institutional ethical approval was obtained from Research Ethics and Governance for the Nepean and Blue Mountains Local Health District (No. 2024/ETH02073). Both participating hospitals were informed and agreed on the study. Because of the retrospective nature of the study, the requirement for informed consent was waived. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.071,t=0.475,r=0.486,b=0.745), with ID 81249c67-93fb-4b5c-a463-4acb72d12b52 -->

*Statistical analysis*

Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics version 25, reporting median age of patients, prevalence of DS and IS, presence or absence of SBO, spinal level of SBO. Chi-squared test and Fisher’s Exact probability test were used for categorical variables and *T*-test for continuous variable. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.072,t=0.770,r=0.486,b=0.898), with ID d1220b19-d9af-463d-be6d-65900fefb5e9 -->

## Results

A total of 2,007 patient records were reviewed, with 351 excluded based on the exclusion criteria. Imaging for 1,656 patients was analysed, of which 20 lacked available images; 388 patients were diagnosed with spondylolisthesis, yielding a prevalence of 23.4% among all surgical patients (*Figure 1*). Of those patients we reviewed CT lumbar spine in 343 patients, and the rest (n=45) we reviewed MRI Lumbar spine along with lumbar spine X-rays. No cases with spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were observed. Mean age in DS group was 69 (range, 41–91) years, and in IS group was 54 (range, 23–83) years (P<0.05) (*Table 2*). In the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9%, while in the IS group, it was 24.7% (P value =0.002). Patients with DS and SBO were more likely to present with grade 2 spondylolisthesis compared to those without SBO [risk ratio (RR) 3.09, P value =0.04]. The male-to-female ratio for IS patients with SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for DS patients with SBO (P value =0.004) (*Table 3*). All patients with DS and SBO had their defect level at S1. Whereas in the IS and SBO group (n=23), 3 patients had their defect at L5, 16 at S1, 2 at L5 and S1, 2 had S1–S4 bifid spine (*Table 4*). <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.513,t=0.270,r=0.929,b=0.664), with ID dbcfd8a2-8aee-45d1-923b-0f7b384a3e4e -->

Discussion

Our findings indicate that the prevalence of SBO in DS surgical patients is 11.9%, comparable to the 12.4% prevalence reported by Eubanks in the general population. Conversely, the 24.7% prevalence of SBO in IS surgical patients contrasts with the 41.2% reported in paediatric populations by Urrutia et al. (7), potentially reflecting differences in spinal maturity (8). Additionally, patients with DS and SBO exhibited a higher grade of spondylolisthesis, suggesting a possible biomechanical weakness, although this was argued by Sairoy et al. (9).

Summary : This flowchart illustrates the inclusion and exclusion process for patients in a spinal surgery study, detailing how the final cohort of patients with spondylolisthesis was selected from an initial pool of 2,007 spinal operations.

flowchart:
# Nodes :
  • Total spinal operations (rectangle): "Total spinal operations (n=2,007)"
  • Prior surgery (rectangle): "Prior surgery (n=107)"
  • No prior surgery (rectangle): "No prior surgery (n=1,900)"
  • Patients met exclusion criteria (rectangle): "Patients met exclusion criteria (n=224)"
  • Patients met inclusion criteria (rectangle): "Patients met inclusion criteria (n=1,676)"
  • Images not available (rectangle): "Images not available (n=20)"
  • Images available (rectangle): "Images available (n=1,656)"
  • Patients without spondylolisthesis (rectangle): "Patients without spondylolisthesis (n=1,268)"
  • Patients with spondylolisthesis (rectangle): "Patients with spondylolisthesis (n=388)"
  • Isthmic spondylolisthesis (rectangle): "Isthmic spondylolisthesis (n=93)"
  • Degenerative spondylolisthesis (rectangle): "Degenerative spondylolisthesis (n=295)"

# Connectors :
  • Downward arrows connect each main node in sequence, showing progression.
  • Rightward arrows from each main node indicate exclusion branches:
    – From "Total spinal operations" to "Prior surgery"
    – From "No prior surgery" to "Patients met exclusion criteria"
    – From "Patients met inclusion criteria" to "Images not available"
    – From "Images available" to "Patients without spondylolisthesis"
  • Final split from "Patients with spondylolisthesis" to two subtypes: "Isthmic spondylolisthesis" and "Degenerative spondylolisthesis".

# Layout :
  • Vertical flow from top ("Total spinal operations") to bottom ("Isthmic spondylolisthesis" and "Degenerative spondylolisthesis").
  • Exclusion branches extend horizontally to the right at each step.
  • The final node splits into two parallel branches at the bottom.

# Analysis :
  • The flowchart demonstrates a stepwise exclusion process, with the majority of exclusions occurring due to lack of spondylolisthesis (n=1,268) and exclusion criteria (n=224).
  • Of the initial 2,007 spinal operations, only 388 patients with spondylolisthesis were included, further divided into 93 with isthmic and 295 with degenerative spondylolisthesis.
  • The chart provides a clear visual summary of patient selection and attrition at each stage. <!-- figure, from page 3 (l=0.072,t=0.103,r=0.746,b=0.571), with ID 0636ba8f-4acb-4f2c-bcb9-117e1ce19aee -->

Limitations of our study include its retrospective nature and the restricted population from two public hospitals in Western Sydney, as well as incomplete access to some imaging studies. Forty-five patients with spondylolisthesis had MRI lumbar spine but no CT lumbar spine available for review. This study is limited to spinal levels L4–S1. However, it included patients listed for surgery over a long-time span (2015 to 2023), from two different tertiary public hospitals, treated under the care of both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. This makes this research more generalizable in public hospital setting treating <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.071,t=0.540,r=0.486,b=0.728), with ID 1cc3bdd9-b2d5-4a22-92a4-f6287fecd8e3 -->

lower lumbar spine pathology. This research is the first
to specifically examine a surgical cohort regarding the
prevalence of SBO, making it particularly relevant for adult
spine surgeons. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.515,t=0.299,r=0.928,b=0.367), with ID aaf0d5f3-a073-41fc-89d7-2a95ac5aea56 -->

To mitigate biases inherent in retrospective studies, future research should establish a prospective database for patient data collection and create a national database for centralized data collection from all public and private centres. Further investigations should also assess the risk of unintended durotomy associated with unrecognized SBO, emphasizing the importance of awareness regarding this rare but preventable complication. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.514,t=0.368,r=0.929,b=0.504), with ID 26afa6de-0e13-4698-8240-3dcab0f66c47 -->

## Conclusions

SBO is an often-overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS. With a prevalence of 11.9% in DS at the lower lumbar spine, it is sufficiently common that spine surgeons should routinely consider it, especially when planning open posterior lumbar spine fusion surgeries to avoid unintended durotomy and neurological damage. Awareness of the absence of the S1 spinous process is crucial for effective surgical planning, particularly when utilizing navigated spinous process clamps for pedicle screw placement (*Figure 2*). <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.514,t=0.529,r=0.929,b=0.727), with ID 4f80331c-2c2e-437f-9f7c-35dc51f2e79b -->

Summary : This figure presents two computed tomography (CT) images of the lumbar spine in different planes to illustrate bony anatomy and possible pathology.

photo:
# Panel Overview :
  • Panel A (left): Sagittal CT image of the lumbar spine.
  • Panel B (right): Axial CT image of a lumbar vertebra.

# Scene Overview :
  • Main subject: Bony structures of the lumbar vertebrae.
  • Panel A: Side view showing vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and posterior elements.
  • Panel B: Cross-sectional view at the level of a vertebral body, displaying the vertebral body, pedicles, laminae, spinous process, and transverse processes.
  • Both images are grayscale, typical of CT bone window settings.

# Technical Details :
  • Imaging modality: Computed tomography (CT), bone window.
  • No scale bar or magnification indicator present.
  • No visible on-image text other than panel labels ("A" and "B").

# Spatial Relationships :
  • Panel A: Vertebral bodies are aligned vertically; intervertebral disc spaces are visible between them.
  • Panel B: Vertebral body is centrally located; pedicles and posterior elements are symmetrically arranged on either side.

# Analysis :
  • The images provide complementary views of lumbar spine anatomy, useful for assessing bone integrity, alignment, and possible fractures or degenerative changes. No obvious acute fracture or gross malalignment is visible in these images. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.091,t=0.106,r=0.906,b=0.369), with ID f87e7ecd-b62f-4754-98f1-bf624d452f54 -->

Summary : This figure presents three computed tomography (CT) images of the lower spine and pelvis, labeled C, D, and E, showing sagittal and axial views for anatomical assessment.

  • The figure consists of three grayscale CT scan slices.
  • Panels C and D display sagittal (side) views of the lumbar spine and sacrum.
  • Panel E shows an axial (horizontal) view of the pelvis, including the sacrum and iliac bones.
  • All images are oriented with anatomical structures clearly visible; vertebrae, sacrum, and pelvic bones are identifiable.

# Technical Details :
  • CT imaging modality, bone window setting.
  • No scale bars or magnification indicators are present.
  • Panels are labeled in the upper left corners: "C", "D", and "E".
  • No on-image text or UI elements other than panel labels.

# Spatial Relationships :
  • Panels C and D: Sagittal slices show vertebral alignment, sacral curvature, and adjacent soft tissue.
  • Panel E: Axial slice displays the sacrum centrally, with iliac bones on either side and the pelvic ring structure.
  • The images are arranged left-to-right (C, D, E).

# Analysis :
  • The figure provides complementary anatomical views for evaluating the lumbar spine and pelvic region.
  • Vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, sacrum, and pelvic bones are well visualized.
  • No obvious fractures, dislocations, or gross abnormalities are apparent in the displayed slices.
  • The arrangement allows for comparison between sagittal and axial perspectives for diagnostic purposes. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.087,t=0.370,r=0.908,b=0.635), with ID 6f08631d-d090-46e9-aed6-bd065e7ee40e -->

**Background:** Spondylolisthesis is defined as the anterior or posterior translation of one vertebral body over another. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is a developmental anomaly characterized by the incomplete fusion of the laminae of one or more vertebral arches along the midline. Currently, there is no documented prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing spinal surgery. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of SBO in patients with DS undergoing spine surgery and compare it with that in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS) undergoing surgery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.165,t=0.378,r=0.836,b=0.479), with ID 6b94881b-3a3f-4997-b62e-b202fe938d10 -->

**Methods:** Our study is a cross-sectional retrospective review of consecutive patient records from two major tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia, covering the period from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2023. Patients diagnosed with spondylolisthesis at spinal levels L4/L5 or L5/S1 were identified and screened for the presence of SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.166,t=0.479,r=0.835,b=0.545), with ID 508648ff-22ec-4dbb-8b79-f4cba4ea4715 -->

**Results:** Among the patients who underwent spinal surgery, 23.4% were found to have spondylolisthesis due to either degenerative changes or isthmic pars defects at L4/L5 or L5/S1. Within the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9% (all at the S1 level), while 24.7% of the IS group exhibited SBO. The male-to-female ratio for patients with IS and SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for those with DS and SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.545,r=0.834,b=0.612), with ID f3634ffd-2583-481a-b338-e315c5f33031 -->

**Conclusions:** SBO is a frequently overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS. With a prevalence of 11.9% in DS, it is crucial for spine surgeons to be vigilant, especially during open posterior lumbar spine fusion surgeries, to prevent unintended durotomy and neurological damage. Awareness of the absence of the S1 spinous process is essential for effective surgical planning, particularly when using navigated spinous process clamps for pedicle screw placement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.612,r=0.835,b=0.697), with ID 99963502-9715-4b06-b991-0fa047450334 -->

Introduction

*Background*

The term spondylolisthesis originates from the Greek words “spondylos”, meaning vertebra, and “olisthánein” meaning “to slip” (1). It broadly refers to the displacement of one vertebral body over another. In 1976, Wiltse *et al.* (2) classified spondylolisthesis into five categories: dysplastic, isthmic, degenerative, traumatic, and pathological. Epidemiological data on spondylolisthesis varies widely, with reported prevalence ranging from 2.7% to 28% (3,4), influenced by factors such as age, sex, and whether the population is symptomatic or asymptomatic. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is the most benign form of spina bifida, involves the failure of the laminae to fuse. The prevalence of SBO in adults can be as high as 12.4% (5). While a correlation between SBO and spondylolysis is recognized with prevalence ranging from 22–70% (6), the prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing surgery remains unreported. The most common levels of spondylolisthesis are L4/L5 and L5/S1 (4) and whence we elected to only include those levels in our study. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.071,t=0.106,r=0.484,b=0.494), with ID f9e200c5-464b-4c1f-bd08-0ac37e247e7a -->

With the advent of navigated instrumentation and spinal process clamps, awareness of the absence of the spinous process is vital for effective surgical planning. There is no reported prevalence of SBO in a surgical cohort with DS. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.515,t=0.108,r=0.928,b=0.192), with ID 910f1e33-1f34-4cf5-a04a-1d3085385d76 -->

*Objective*

This study aims to quantify the prevalence of SBO in a cohort of surgical patients with either DS or isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS). Most existing studies on spondylolisthesis prevalence focus on asymptomatic populations, neglecting symptomatic surgical cohorts. Our research seeks to raise awareness of SBO and quantify its prevalence among patients treated for symptomatic lower back pathology, categorizing them based on degenerative versus IS and the presence or absence of SBO. We present this article in accordance with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at https://jss.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/jss-24-151/rc). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.515,t=0.216,r=0.928,b=0.443), with ID 3d51108a-22c2-44ad-8d7c-6d8e324e9d52 -->

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional retrospective review of patient records from two tertiary hospitals in Sydney (Nepean Public Hospital and Westmead Public Hospital), covering surgeries conducted between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2023. Surgeries were performed by both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. Inclusion criteria included patients aged over 18 years who underwent surgery at spinal levels L4–S1, with imaging available for review. Exclusion criteria encompassed surgeries at levels other than L4–S1, surgeries conducted prior to the study period, unavailability of imaging, and spondylolisthesis due to causes other than degenerative or isthmic factors, spondylolisthesis at level other than L4–S1 (*Table 1*). Patients’ electronic medical records were accessed, and baseline demographic data (age, sex) were collected. Imaging [X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] was reviewed for the presence of spondylolisthesis, its level, aetiology (based on Wiltse classification), grade (according to Meyerding grading), and presence of SBO and its level. Other pathologies like spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were screened for. Most patients’ images were available on the hospitals Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS); however, some patients had their images done at private radiology providers outside the hospital PACS. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.514,t=0.466,r=0.929,b=0.913), with ID 1ac282aa-8431-4e8d-971e-162a9ca7de53 -->

For those patients the individual radiology provider was contacted for access to patients scans. The authors (A.A.W., Y.L.) reviewed the images, consulting reporting radiologists in cases of disagreement. CT scan for some patients was not available, and data collection was reliant on MRI and X-rays. Patients who had no images available for review were excluded. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.070,t=0.271,r=0.487,b=0.389), with ID ecebb9eb-4b53-4a17-9633-d116d6761bc6 -->

Sampling bias was reduced by taking all effort to include all patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria in both hospital sites and including patients operated on by both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. Patients with no scans available were excluded. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.071,t=0.391,r=0.486,b=0.474), with ID fdab24c4-9bc6-412e-a24e-db5521e04fc9 -->

Power calculation was conducted to determine the sample size required to detect a significant difference of SBO prevalence between DS and IS. The analysis aimed for a power of 0.8 with an alpha level set at 0.05, indicating a 5% risk of type 1 error. Based on expected prevalence of 12% in DS and 30% in IS, the required sample sizes were calculated to be 173 in DS and 58 in IS, resulting in a total sample size of 231 participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments. Local institutional ethical approval was obtained from Research Ethics and Governance for the Nepean and Blue Mountains Local Health District (No. 2024/ETH02073). Both participating hospitals were informed and agreed on the study. Because of the retrospective nature of the study, the requirement for informed consent was waived. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.071,t=0.475,r=0.486,b=0.745), with ID 58d106b9-c197-4931-9a97-734060e36680 -->

*Statistical analysis*

Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics version 25, reporting median age of patients, prevalence of DS and IS, presence or absence of SBO, spinal level of SBO. Chi-squared test and Fisher’s Exact probability test were used for categorical variables and *T*-test for continuous variable. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.072,t=0.770,r=0.486,b=0.898), with ID 015c97ef-c3c1-48d3-baed-ac69239a4310 -->

## Results

A total of 2,007 patient records were reviewed, with 351 excluded based on the exclusion criteria. Imaging for 1,656 patients was analysed, of which 20 lacked available images; 388 patients were diagnosed with spondylolisthesis, yielding a prevalence of 23.4% among all surgical patients (*Figure 1*). Of those patients we reviewed CT lumbar spine in 343 patients, and the rest (n=45) we reviewed MRI Lumbar spine along with lumbar spine X-rays. No cases with spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were observed. Mean age in DS group was 69 (range, 41–91) years, and in IS group was 54 (range, 23–83) years (P<0.05) (*Table 2*). In the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9%, while in the IS group, it was 24.7% (P value =0.002). Patients with DS and SBO were more likely to present with grade 2 spondylolisthesis compared to those without SBO [risk ratio (RR) 3.09, P value =0.04]. The male-to-female ratio for IS patients with SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for DS patients with SBO (P value =0.004) (*Table 3*). All patients with DS and SBO had their defect level at S1. Whereas in the IS and SBO group (n=23), 3 patients had their defect at L5, 16 at S1, 2 at L5 and S1, 2 had S1–S4 bifid spine (*Table 4*). <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.513,t=0.270,r=0.929,b=0.664), with ID ab2ceabd-ce33-4ad0-9cad-650e9ef4cb30 -->

Discussion

Our findings indicate that the prevalence of SBO in DS surgical patients is 11.9%, comparable to the 12.4% prevalence reported by Eubanks in the general population. Conversely, the 24.7% prevalence of SBO in IS surgical patients contrasts with the 41.2% reported in paediatric populations by Urrutia _et al._ (7), potentially reflecting differences in spinal maturity (8). Additionally, patients with DS and SBO exhibited a higher grade of spondylolisthesis, suggesting a possible biomechanical weakness, although this was argued by Sairyo _et al._ (9).

  • Final split: Patients with spondylolisthesis branches into Isthmic spondylolisthesis and Degenerative spondylolisthesis.

# Layout :
  • Vertical flow from top (Total spinal operations) to bottom (Isthmic/ Degenerative spondylolisthesis).
  • At each step, rightward branches indicate excluded groups.
  • The final node splits horizontally into two outcome categories.

# Analysis :
  • The flowchart systematically narrows down from 2,007 total spinal operations to 388 patients with spondylolisthesis, further categorised into 93 with isthmic and 295 with degenerative spondylolisthesis.
  • The largest exclusions occur at the "Patients without spondylolisthesis" (n=1,268) and "Patients met exclusion criteria" (n=224) steps.

Limitations of our study include its retrospective nature
and the restricted population from two public hospitals
in Western Sydney, as well as incomplete access to some
imaging studies. Forty-five patients with spondylolisthesis
had MRI lumbar spine but no CT lumbar spine available
for review. This study is limited to spinal levels L4–S1.
However, it included patients listed for surgery over a long-
time span (2015 to 2023), from two different tertiary public
hospitals, treated under the care of both neurosurgeons
and orthopaedic spine surgeons. This makes this research
more generalizable in public hospital setting treating <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.071,t=0.540,r=0.486,b=0.728), with ID 604e3d17-e387-4910-8d33-57e22770db53 -->

lower lumbar spine pathology. This research is the first
to specifically examine a surgical cohort regarding the
prevalence of SBO, making it particularly relevant for adult
spine surgeons. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.515,t=0.299,r=0.928,b=0.367), with ID 1e3b8026-65f0-45a7-87cd-590c65a729d2 -->

To mitigate biases inherent in retrospective studies,
future research should establish a prospective database
for patient data collection and create a national database
for centralized data collection from all public and private
centres. Further investigations should also assess the risk of
unintended durotomy associated with unrecognized SBO,
emphasizing the importance of awareness regarding this
rare but preventable complication. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.514,t=0.368,r=0.929,b=0.504), with ID 621a078a-117d-4297-92cd-d3ca94672f0a -->

## Conclusions

SBO is an often-overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS. With a prevalence of 11.9% in DS at the lower lumbar spine, it is sufficiently common that spine surgeons should routinely consider it, especially when planning open posterior lumbar spine fusion surgeries to avoid unintended durotomy and neurological damage. Awareness of the absence of the S1 spinous process is crucial for effective surgical planning, particularly when utilizing navigated spinous process clamps for pedicle screw placement (*Figure 2*). <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.514,t=0.529,r=0.929,b=0.727), with ID 3114d834-1cf9-4106-9da6-4b67057cafc6 -->

Summary : This figure presents two computed tomography (CT) images of the lumbar spine in different planes, illustrating vertebral anatomy and alignment.

photo:
# Panel Overview :
  • Panel A (left): Sagittal CT image of the lumbar spine.
  • Panel B (right): Axial CT image of a lumbar vertebra.

# Scene Overview :
  • Main subject: Bony structures of the lumbar vertebrae.
  • Setting: Medical imaging, grayscale CT scans.
  • Perspective: 
    – Panel A: Sagittal (side) view showing multiple vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and the spinal canal.
    – Panel B: Axial (horizontal) view at the level of a single vertebra, showing vertebral body, pedicles, laminae, and spinal canal.

# Technical Details :
  • Modality: Computed tomography (CT).
  • No visible scale bar or magnification indicator.
  • Panels labeled “A” and “B” in the upper left corners.
  • High-contrast bone window settings highlight cortical and trabecular bone.

# Spatial Relationships :
  • Panel A: Vertebral bodies are stacked vertically, with intervertebral discs between them; spinal canal is posterior to the vertebral bodies.
  • Panel B: Vertebral body is central, with pedicles and laminae forming the vertebral arch; spinal canal is centrally located.

# Analysis :
  • The images clearly depict normal vertebral alignment and bony anatomy in both sagittal and axial planes.
  • No obvious fractures, dislocations, or gross deformities are visible in the provided images.
  • The sagittal view allows assessment of vertebral height and disc spaces, while the axial view provides detail of the vertebral arch and canal dimensions. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.091,t=0.106,r=0.906,b=0.369), with ID b15dda63-d3a6-4390-bd13-1281c6c36921 -->

Summary : This figure presents three computed tomography (CT) images of the lower spine and pelvis in both sagittal and axial planes, labeled C, D, and E, to illustrate bony anatomy and possible pathology.

photo:
# Scene Overview :
  • Three grayscale CT images arranged horizontally, labeled C (left), D (center), and E (right).
  • Images C and D are sagittal views of the lumbar spine and sacrum; image E is an axial view of the pelvis.
  • The images focus on bone structures, including vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, and pelvic bones.
  • No visible scale bars or measurement markers.

# Technical Details :
  • CT modality, bone window setting (high contrast for cortical bone).
  • Sagittal slices (C, D) show vertebral alignment, disc spaces, and sacral curvature.
  • Axial slice (E) shows the sacrum, iliac bones, and sacroiliac joints.
  • Labels “C”, “D”, and “E” in the upper left corners of each respective image.

# Spatial Relationships :
  • Sagittal images (C, D) display the lumbar vertebrae stacked vertically, sacrum angled posteriorly, coccyx visible at the base.
  • Axial image (E) provides a cross-sectional view through the sacrum and pelvis, with iliac bones on either side.
  • All images are centered on the midline structures.

# Analysis :
  • The images collectively provide complementary views of the lumbosacral spine and pelvis, useful for assessing bone integrity, alignment, and potential pathology.
  • No obvious fractures, dislocations, or gross deformities are visible in the provided slices.
  • The sacrum and coccyx appear intact; vertebral bodies and disc spaces are preserved.
  • The axial view (E) allows assessment of sacroiliac joint symmetry and pelvic ring continuity. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.087,t=0.370,r=0.908,b=0.635), with ID 2529ee41-bd77-4907-8d68-45373681074f -->

**Background:** Spondylolisthesis is defined as the anterior or posterior translation of one vertebral body over another. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is a developmental anomaly characterized by the incomplete fusion of the laminae of one or more vertebral arches along the midline. Currently, there is no documented prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing spinal surgery. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of SBO in patients with DS undergoing spine surgery and compare it with that in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS) undergoing surgery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.165,t=0.378,r=0.836,b=0.479), with ID 09e074f9-1c37-4ad8-96c4-a3476921d1a2 -->

**Methods:** Our study is a cross-sectional retrospective review of consecutive patient records from two major tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia, covering the period from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2023. Patients diagnosed with spondylolisthesis at spinal levels L4/L5 or L5/S1 were identified and screened for the presence of SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.166,t=0.479,r=0.835,b=0.545), with ID 18179378-bb63-460e-b19c-f0cb928fd4f6 -->

**Results:** Among the patients who underwent spinal surgery, 23.4% were found to have spondylolisthesis due to either degenerative changes or isthmic pars defects at L4/L5 or L5/S1. Within the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9% (all at the S1 level), while 24.7% of the IS group exhibited SBO. The male-to-female ratio for patients with IS and SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for those with DS and SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.545,r=0.834,b=0.612), with ID bb9c254c-7df3-4b18-adf0-f77e4c8c1b02 -->

Introduction

*Background*

The term spondylolisthesis originates from the Greek words “spondylos”, meaning vertebra, and “olisthánein” meaning “to slip” (1). It broadly refers to the displacement of one vertebral body over another. In 1976, Wiltse *et al.* (2) classified spondylolisthesis into five categories: dysplastic, isthmic, degenerative, traumatic, and pathological. Epidemiological data on spondylolisthesis varies widely, with reported prevalence ranging from 2.7% to 28% (3,4), influenced by factors such as age, sex, and whether the population is symptomatic or asymptomatic. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is the most benign form of spina bifida, involves the failure of the laminae to fuse. The prevalence of SBO in adults can be as high as 12.4% (5). While a correlation between SBO and spondylolysis is recognized with prevalence ranging from 22–70% (6), the prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing surgery remains unreported. The most common levels of spondylolisthesis are L4/L5 and L5/S1 (4) and whence we elected to only include those levels in our study. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.071,t=0.106,r=0.484,b=0.494), with ID ea8f7465-85e8-4bf7-affb-a31d88bb3608 -->

the advent of navigated instrumentation and spinal process

*Objective*

This study aims to quantify the prevalence of SBO in a cohort of surgical patients with either DS or isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS). Most existing studies on spondylolisthesis prevalence focus on asymptomatic populations, neglecting symptomatic surgical cohorts. Our research seeks to raise awareness of SBO and quantify its prevalence among patients treated for symptomatic lower back pathology, categorizing them based on degenerative versus IS and the presence or absence of SBO. We present this article in accordance with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at https://jss.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/jss-24-151/rc). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.515,t=0.216,r=0.928,b=0.443), with ID 5812e17f-f4b9-40e4-a3df-54c656f83485 -->

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional retrospective review of patient records from two tertiary hospitals in Sydney (Nepean Public Hospital and Westmead Public Hospital), covering surgeries conducted between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2023. Surgeries were performed by both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. Inclusion criteria included patients aged over 18 years who underwent surgery at spinal levels L4–S1, with imaging available for review. Exclusion criteria encompassed surgeries at levels other than L4–S1, surgeries conducted prior to the study period, unavailability of imaging, and spondylolisthesis due to causes other than degenerative or isthmic factors, spondylolisthesis at level other than L4–S1 (*Table 1*). Patients’ electronic medical records were accessed, and baseline demographic data (age, sex) were collected. Imaging [X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] was reviewed for the presence of spondylolisthesis, its level, aetiology (based on Wiltse classification), grade (according to Meyerding grading), and presence of SBO and its level. Other pathologies like spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were screened for. Most patients’ images were available on the hospitals Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS); however, some patients had their images done at private radiology providers outside the hospital PACS. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.514,t=0.466,r=0.929,b=0.913), with ID 1e1df3d9-eab6-47f3-90de-1efb82d47e79 -->

For those patients the individual radiology provider was contacted for access to patients scans. The authors (A.A.W., Y.L.) reviewed the images, consulting reporting radiologists in cases of disagreement. CT scan for some patients was not available, and data collection was reliant on MRI and X-rays.

Power calculation was conducted to determine the sample size required to detect a significant difference of SBO prevalence between DS and IS. The analysis aimed for a power of 0.8 with an alpha level set at 0.05, indicating a 5% risk of type 1 error. Based on expected prevalence of 12% in DS and 30% in IS, the required sample sizes were calculated to be 173 in DS and 58 in IS, resulting in a total sample size of 231 participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments. Local institutional ethical approval was obtained from Research Ethics and Governance for the Nepean and Blue Mountains Local Health District (No. 2024/ETH02073). Both participating hospitals were informed and agreed on the study. Because of the retrospective nature of the study, the requirement for informed consent was waived. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.071,t=0.475,r=0.486,b=0.745), with ID cbc446ec-e36a-4b11-98d6-c7956fcc9d31 -->

*Statistical analysis*

Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics version 25, reporting median age of patients, prevalence of DS and IS, presence or absence of SBO, spinal level of SBO. Chi-squared test and Fisher’s Exact probability test were used for categorical variables and *T*-test for continuous variable. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.072,t=0.770,r=0.486,b=0.898), with ID 3afbab05-e541-48e4-ac88-5e7b67f2b39f -->

## Results

A total of 2,007 patient records were reviewed, with 351 excluded based on the exclusion criteria. Imaging for 1,656 patients was analysed, of which 20 lacked available images; 388 patients were diagnosed with spondylolisthesis, yielding a prevalence of 23.4% among all surgical patients (*Figure 1*). Of those patients we reviewed CT lumbar spine in 343 patients, and the rest (n=45) we reviewed MRI Lumbar spine along with lumbar spine X-rays. No cases with spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were observed. Mean age in DS group was 69 (range, 41–91) years, and in IS group was 54 (range, 23–83) years (P<0.05) (*Table 2*). In the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9%, while in the IS group, it was 24.7% (P value =0.002). Patients with DS and SBO were more likely to present with grade 2 spondylolisthesis compared to those without SBO [risk ratio (RR) 3.09, P value =0.04]. The male-to-female ratio for IS patients with SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for DS patients with SBO (P value =0.004) (*Table 3*). All patients with DS and SBO had their defect level at S1. Whereas in the IS and SBO group (n=23), 3 patients had their defect at L5, 16 at S1, 2 at L5 and S1, 2 had S1–S4 bifid spine (*Table 4*). <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.513,t=0.270,r=0.929,b=0.664), with ID 81777775-1d54-4401-a251-922dd8adcc6b -->

Discussion

Our findings indicate that the prevalence of SBO in DS surgical patients is 11.9%, comparable to the 12.4% prevalence reported by Eubanks in the general population. Conversely, the 24.7% prevalence of SBO in IS surgical patients contrasts with the 41.2% reported in paediatric populations by Urrutia *et al.* (7), potentially reflecting differences in spinal maturity (8). Additionally, patients with DS and SBO exhibited a higher grade of spondylolisthesis, suggesting a possible biomechanical weakness, although this was argued by Sairyo *et al.* (9).

Limitations of our study include its retrospective nature and the restricted population from two public hospitals in Western Sydney, as well as incomplete access to some imaging studies. Forty-five patients with spondylolisthesis had MRI lumbar spine but no CT lumbar spine available for review. This study is limited to spinal levels L4–S1. However, it included patients listed for surgery over a long-time span (2015 to 2023), from two different tertiary public hospitals, treated under the care of both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. This makes this research more generalizable in public hospital setting treating <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.071,t=0.540,r=0.486,b=0.728), with ID f9227908-2c16-4798-933d-c11bba8d9c83 -->

lower lumbar spine pathology. This research is the first
to specifically examine a surgical cohort regarding the
prevalence of SBO, making it particularly relevant for adult
spine surgeons. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.515,t=0.299,r=0.928,b=0.367), with ID 734f2849-90ea-4a58-bb14-44160766d2ee -->

To mitigate biases inherent in retrospective studies, future research should establish a prospective database for patient data collection and create a national database for centralized data collection from all public and private centres. Further investigations should also assess the risk of unintended durotomy associated with unrecognized SBO, emphasizing the importance of awareness regarding this rare but preventable complication. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.514,t=0.368,r=0.929,b=0.504), with ID f518ead2-75c0-4de5-ba03-9bdc6c2eb56d -->

## Conclusions

SBO is an often-overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS. With a prevalence of 11.9% in DS at the lower lumbar spine, it is sufficiently common that spine surgeons should routinely consider it, especially when planning open posterior lumbar spine fusion surgeries to avoid unintended durotomy and neurological damage.

Summary : This figure presents two computed tomography (CT) images of the lumbar spine in different planes to illustrate bony anatomy and possible pathology.

photo:
# Panel Overview :
  • Panel A (left): Sagittal CT image of the lumbar spine.
  • Panel B (right): Axial CT image of the lumbar spine at a vertebral level.

# Scene Overview :
  • Main subject: Bony structures of the lumbar vertebrae.
  • Panel A: Side view showing vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and posterior elements.
  • Panel B: Cross-sectional view showing vertebral body, pedicles, laminae, spinous process, and facet joints.
  • Both images are grayscale, typical of CT bone window settings.

# Technical Details :
  • Imaging modality: Computed tomography (CT), bone window.
  • No scale bar or magnification indicator visible.
  • No contrast or staining; standard radiological grayscale.
  • Panel labels “A” and “B” in upper left corners.

# Spatial Relationships :
  • Panel A: Vertebral bodies aligned vertically; intervertebral disc spaces visible; sacrum and lower lumbar vertebrae at bottom.
  • Panel B: Vertebral body centered; pedicles and posterior elements symmetrically arranged; spinal canal visible centrally.

# Analysis :
  • The images provide complementary anatomical perspectives: sagittal for vertebral alignment and disc height, axial for cross-sectional bony detail.
  • No obvious fractures, dislocations, or gross deformities are visible in the provided images.
  • The figure is suitable for illustrating normal lumbar spine anatomy or for comparison in pathology-focused studies. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.091,t=0.106,r=0.906,b=0.369), with ID 31dfe718-2dbd-4c32-98a9-b2d004c42d49 -->

Summary : This figure presents three CT scan images of the lower spine and pelvis in sagittal and axial views, labeled C, D, and E, to illustrate bony anatomy and possible pathology.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The figure consists of three grayscale CT images.
  • Panels C and D show sagittal (side) views of the lumbar spine and sacrum.
  • Panel E shows an axial (horizontal) view through the pelvis at the level of the sacrum.
  • Vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, sacrum, coccyx, and pelvic bones are visible.
  • The images are labeled in the upper left corners as C, D, and E.

Technical Details :
  • CT imaging modality, bone window setting.
  • No visible scale bar or magnification indicator.
  • No on-image text other than panel labels.
  • High contrast between bone (white) and soft tissue (gray/black).

Spatial Relationships :
  • Sagittal images (C, D) show the alignment and morphology of the lumbar vertebrae, sacrum, and coccyx.
  • Axial image (E) shows the cross-sectional anatomy of the sacrum, sacroiliac joints, and adjacent pelvic bones.
  • The images are arranged left-to-right: two sagittal, one axial.

Analysis :
  • The images provide detailed visualization of the bony structures of the lower spine and pelvis.
  • No obvious fractures, dislocations, or gross deformities are visible in the provided images.
  • The arrangement allows for comparison between sagittal and axial perspectives of the same anatomical region. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.087,t=0.370,r=0.908,b=0.635), with ID 12e13a26-421b-452e-ab07-86b1eb8c54b6 -->
