**Background:** Spondylolisthesis is defined as the anterior or posterior translation of one vertebral body over another. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is a developmental anomaly characterized by the incomplete fusion of the laminae of one or more vertebral arches along the midline. Currently, there is no documented prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing spinal surgery. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of SBO in patients with DS undergoing spine surgery and compare it with that in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS) undergoing surgery. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.165,t=0.378,r=0.836,b=0.479), with ID a136b95a-55d0-440c-a57e-e60e8cab4d08 -->

**Methods:** Our study is a cross-sectional retrospective review of consecutive patient records from two major tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia, covering the period from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2023. Patients diagnosed with spondylolisthesis at spinal levels L4/L5 or L5/S1 were identified and screened for the presence of SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.166,t=0.479,r=0.835,b=0.545), with ID 3d91945f-456a-4e6c-9003-2089309f0f0d -->

**Results:** Among the patients who underwent spinal surgery, 23.4% were found to have spondylolisthesis due to either degenerative changes or isthmic pars defects at L4/L5 or L5/S1.

--- Chunk 4 ---
Within the DS group, the prevalence of SBO was 11.9% (all at the S1 level), while 24.7% of the IS group exhibited SBO. The male-to-female ratio for patients with IS and SBO was 3.6:1, compared to 0.66:1 for those with DS and SBO. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.545,r=0.834,b=0.612), with ID 8ea54124-7e81-46c3-a227-3139bcaddaac -->

**Conclusions:** SBO is a frequently overlooked anatomical variation in adult spine surgery, particularly in cases of degenerative and IS. With a prevalence of 11.9% in DS, it is crucial for spine surgeons to be vigilant, especially during open posterior lumbar spine fusion surgeries, to prevent unintended durotomy and neurological damage. Awareness of the absence of the S1 spinous process is essential for effective surgical planning, particularly when using navigated spinous process clamps for pedicle screw placement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.167,t=0.612,r=0.835,b=0.697), with ID 8ca48984-3e18-4186-90aa-882e7eb4c7c7 -->

Introduction

*Background*

The term spondylolisthesis originates from the Greek words “spondylos”, meaning vertebra, and “olisthánein” meaning “to slip” (1). It broadly refers to the displacement of one vertebral body over another. In 1976, Wiltse *et al.* (2) classified spondylolisthesis into five categories: dysplastic, isthmic, degenerative, traumatic, and pathological. Epidemiological data on spondylolisthesis varies widely, with reported prevalence ranging from 2.7% to 28% (3,4), influenced by factors such as age, sex, and whether the population is symptomatic or asymptomatic. Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is the most benign form of spina bifida, involves the failure of the laminae to fuse. The prevalence of SBO in adults can be as high as 12.4% (5). While a correlation between SBO and spondylolysis is recognized with prevalence ranging from 22–70% (6), the prevalence of SBO in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) undergoing surgery remains unreported. The most common levels of spondylolisthesis are L4/L5 and L5/S1 (4) and whence we elected to only include those levels in our study.

**What is the implication, and what should change now?**
- • Increased awareness of this occult condition to help plan safe surgery on the lumbar spine.
- • Careful examination of pre-operative imaging for patients planned for surgery on the lower lumbar spine screening for spina bifida occulta. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.077,t=0.613,r=0.480,b=0.909), with ID 6dcdcb6a-4fed-427e-9dcd-414b94a92e3d -->

*Objective*

This study aims to quantify the prevalence of SBO in a cohort of surgical patients with either DS or isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS). Most existing studies on spondylolisthesis prevalence focus on asymptomatic populations, neglecting symptomatic surgical cohorts. Our research seeks to raise awareness of SBO and quantify its prevalence among patients treated for symptomatic lower back pathology, categorizing them based on degenerative versus IS and the presence or absence of SBO. We present this article in accordance with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at https://jss.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/jss-24-151/rc). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.515,t=0.216,r=0.928,b=0.443), with ID a479b81d-7d4e-4490-b023-ddead925a69b -->

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional retrospective review of patient records from two tertiary hospitals in Sydney (Nepean Public Hospital and Westmead Public Hospital), covering surgeries conducted between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2023. Surgeries were performed by both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons. Inclusion criteria included patients aged over 18 years who underwent surgery at spinal levels L4–S1, with imaging available for review. Exclusion criteria encompassed surgeries at levels other than L4–S1, surgeries conducted prior to the study period, unavailability of imaging, and spondylolisthesis due to causes other than degenerative or isthmic factors, spondylolisthesis at level other than L4–S1 (*Table 1*). Patients’ electronic medical records were accessed, and baseline demographic data (age, sex) were collected.

Patients’ electronic medical records were accessed, and baseline demographic data (age, sex) were collected. Imaging [X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] was reviewed for the presence of spondylolisthesis, its level, aetiology (based on Wiltse classification), grade (according to Meyerding grading), and presence of SBO and its level. Other pathologies like spinal lipoma, limited dorsal myeloschisis and dermal sinus were screened for. Most patients’ images were available on the hospitals Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS); however, some patients had their images done at private radiology providers outside the hospital PACS. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.514,t=0.466,r=0.929,b=0.913), with ID 9227b1d4-2e09-42f2-ae72-8963264ee761 -->
